Interactive SmolAgents quote bot that responds to user requests in Matrix.

This advanced example demonstrates:
1. Interactive messaging with wait_for_response via MCP stdio protocol
2. Different types of quotes based on user mood/request
3. Room management and user interaction

SETUP REQUIREMENTS:
1. Install this package to get the matrix-mcp-server console script:
   uv tool install . 
   (or: uv pip install -e . in your environment)

2. Set environment variables for the MCP server:
   export MATRIX_USERNAME="your-bot@matrix.org"
   export MATRIX_PASSWORD="your-password"
   export MATRIX_ROOMID="#test:matrix.org" 
   export MATRIX_HOMESERVER="https://matrix.org"  # optional
   export MATRIX_DEVICE_NAME="interactive-quote-bot"  # optional

HOW IT WORKS:
- ToolCollection.from_mcp("matrix-mcp-server") spawns the MCP server as subprocess
- SmolAgents communicates with matrix_mcp_server.py via stdin/stdout (stdio MCP)
- The MCP server handles Matrix authentication, room joining, and message handling
- wait_for_response tool sends a message then waits for human responses in Matrix
