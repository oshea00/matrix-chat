"""
SmolAgents example script that generates random inspirational quotes
and sends them to Matrix rooms using the matrix-mcp-server.

This script demonstrates how to:
1. Use SmolAgents with Matrix MCP tools via stdio subprocess communication
2. Generate random quotes with an AI agent  
3. Send messages to Matrix rooms via MCP tools

SETUP REQUIREMENTS:
1. Install this package to get the matrix-mcp-server console script:
   uv tool install . 
   (or: uv pip install -e . in your environment)

2. Set environment variables for the MCP server:
   export MATRIX_USERNAME="your-bot@matrix.org"
   export MATRIX_PASSWORD="your-password"  
   export MATRIX_ROOMID="#test:matrix.org"
   export MATRIX_HOMESERVER="https://matrix.org"  # optional
   export MATRIX_DEVICE_NAME="quote-bot"          # optional

3. ToolCollection.from_mcp("matrix-mcp-server") will:
   - Spawn the "matrix-mcp-server" command as a subprocess
   - Communicate with it via stdin/stdout (stdio MCP protocol)
   - Load the available tools: send_message, wait_for_response, list_rooms
